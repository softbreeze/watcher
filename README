Installation
1) edit "watcher" file, which contains important variables
2) edit function.sh with proper server information (smtp server, port, user, password)
3) if you wish, edit variables in watcher.sh (eg. wheather to run dropbox module, delays and how often certain actions should be performed)
4) run ./watch_inic.sh - it should install the script if run for the first time. WARNING: if you run this script, and INSTALL_DIR points to egisting folder, it will be deleted.
5) now you have to manually add $INSTALL_DIR/watcher.sh to gnome/kde autostart (you can do what is done in next step, but add it to PostLogin dir) 
6) add to /etc/gdm/PostSession/Default folowing line

	logoutscript="$INSTALL_DIR/watcher/stop.sh";
	if [ -x "$logoutscript" ] ; then
	su $USER -c "$logoutscript"
	#`$logoutscript`
	fi

 which will run "stop.sh", which will kill all watcher process and sub-processes on logout.
 Remember to change $INSTALL_DIR in above code!

To do list:
- moving script out of user dir (in progress)
- currently if one of directories are deleted, the scipts stops working - it should be fixed.
- activating user tracking only if "certain user can connect to to internet and certain web page contains certain string"
- keylogger
- using dropbox, ftp and ssh or other to upload data
- (mayby) forcing activation of vnc/ssh
