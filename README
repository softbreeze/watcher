Installation
1) edit "watcher" file, which contains important variables
2) edit function.sh with proper server information (smtp server, port, user, password)
3) run ./watch_inic.sh - it should install the script if run for the first time
4) now you have to manually add $INSTALL_DIR/watcher.sh to gnome/kde autostart (you can do what is done in next step, but add it to PostLogin dir) 
5) add to /etc/gdm/PostSession/Default folowing line

	logoutscript="$INSTALL_DIR/watcher/stop.sh";
	if [ -x "$logoutscript" ] ; then
	su $USER -c "$logoutscript"
	#`$logoutscript`
	fi

 which will run "stop.sh", which will kill all watcher process and sub-processes on logout.
 Remember to change $INSTALL_DIR in above code!

To do list:
- moving script out of user dir
- currently if one of directories are deleted, the scipts stops working - it should be fixed.
- (easy) activating user tracking only if "certain user can connect to to internet and certain web page contains certain string"
