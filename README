Check out wiki at github.com for installation and configuration instructions.

To do list:
- moving script out of user dir (in progress)
- currently if one of directories are deleted, the scipts stops working - it should be fixed.
- activating user tracking only if "certain user can connect to to internet and certain web page contains certain string"
- keylogger
- using ftp and ssh or other to upload data
- (mayby) forcing activation of vnc/ssh

P.S.
Sorry for bad english, but I better speak than write
Sorry for bad code - I'm still learning
